# Golang Log File Generator

## Usage

1) Run the program with `go run .`
2) Enter the number of random log messages you want to generate.
3) That's it! The program will generate your random log messages and write them to a file called 'result_logs.txt'.
    - The program will automatically handle any file creation and deletion necessary to store the logs before they can be combined. 

## Purpose

I got the idea for *this* project while implementing my original log file generator in F#. 

While F# can handle concurrency perfectly fine, since I've recently decided to give Go another try, I figured this could be a great opportunity to learn about its primary benefit.
