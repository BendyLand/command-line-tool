# Go Todo List

This project is to help me attempt to start learning Go. It will be simpler than the other projects in this directory. 

## Motivation

I have tried to learn Go in the past with small, independent tasks, but I have not tried implementing any standalone projects, even small ones. 

I don't dislike Go, but the frustration I have experienced with its toolchain in the past was unrivaled by any other language I've tried, which made it difficult to want to use. This is my attempt to resolve the bitter feeling it previously left.
