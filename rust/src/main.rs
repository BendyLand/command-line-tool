/*  
Idea:
Simple Task Scheduler: 
Build a simple task scheduler program where users can add tasks with deadlines and priorities, and the program organizes and displays the tasks accordingly. This project will require you to design data structures for representing tasks and implement algorithms for task scheduling and prioritization.
