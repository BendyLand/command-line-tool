# F# Random Log File Generator

This program randomly generates a certain number of sample logs and writes them to a file. 

## Purpose

I got the idea for this project as I was working on a different one; a log file parser. I realized that rather than searching for sample log data, I could dedicate another one of these projects to generating the file itself.
