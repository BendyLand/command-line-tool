# F# Random Log File Generator

This program randomly generates a certain number of sample logs and writes them to a file. 

## Usage

1) Run the program with `dotnet run`.
2) You will be prompted to enter the amount of log messages you want to generate.
3) That's it! Your randomly generated log messages will be located in `sample_logs.txt`

## Purpose

I got the idea for this project as I was working on a different one; a log file parser. I realized that rather than searching for sample log data, I could dedicate another one of these projects to generating the file itself.
