# Command Line Tool

This repository is for projects that take the form of command line tools. 

Each tool will be implemented in a different language, and each language be will chosen for this project for a particular purpose. 


## Languages

- Ruby
    - For a general purpose CLI to help me learn techniques and use cases.
- Scala
    - To practice in my preferred language and to practice with static typing.
- F#
    - For a more functional approach.
- Rust
    - To practice writing with performance more as a priority.
- (Bonus): Go
    - I generally avoid using Go because of previous frustration I experienced with its toolchain, but I was getting bored of the same other languages, so I figured I would give it another try. The difficulty of this project is notably lower than the rest of the ones in this directory.
- (Another Bonus): C 
    - I just felt the urge to do some C programming, so I figured a CLI would be a good place to start.


## Objectives

Currently, I have only made very basic CLI tools. By the time this project is implemented in each language, I would like to have increased the average complexity of each tool, as well as improved the practices used in the development of each.
