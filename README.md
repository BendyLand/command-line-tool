# Command Line Tool

This repository is for projects take the form of command line tools. 

Each tool will be implemented in a different language, and each language be will chosen for the project for a particular purpose. 


## Languages

- Ruby
    - For a general purpose CLI to help me learn techniques and use cases.
- Scala
    - To practice in my preferred language and to practice with static typing.
- Kotlin
    - Because Scala isn't as popular in the job market...
- F#
    - For a more functional approach.
- Rust
    - To practice writing with performance as a priority.


## Objectives

Currently, I have only made very basic CLI tools. By the time this project is implemented in each language, I would like to have increased the average complexity of each tool, as well as improved the practices used in the development of each.
